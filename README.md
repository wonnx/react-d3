## Defining visualization
computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.  Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.

## 6 Questions to think about before visualizing your data
What questions do you want to answer?  
What is the problem you are trying to solve?  
What decisions are you trying to make?  
What outcomes are you hopping for?  
What story do you want to tell?  
What tasks should the viewer be able to perform?
